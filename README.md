PDF to Podcast AI Agent

Welcome to the PDF to Podcast AI Agent, a Python-based project that transforms PDF documents into engaging, natural-sounding podcast scripts. Using LangGraph for workflow orchestration and a large language model (LLM) from Together AI, this agent processes PDF content through multiple stages‚Äîoutline creation, transcript generation, dialogue optimization, and final podcast script production. The result is a polished, production-ready podcast dialogue between two hosts, complete with sound cues and conversational flow.
This project is ideal for educators, content creators, or developers looking to automate the conversion of technical documents (e.g., a DBMS textbook) into accessible audio content.

Features

PDF Processing: Extracts text from PDFs to serve as the foundation for podcast content.
Structured Workflow: Uses LangGraph to manage a multi-step pipeline, including outline creation, transcript generation, and dialogue optimization.
Natural Dialogue: Generates engaging, two-person podcast scripts with smooth transitions, humor, and professional tone.
Deep Insights: Enhances content with analogies, background information, and examples for richer discussions.
Audio Output: Converts the final script into audio using a text-to-speech utility (via create_audio).
Environment Safety: Securely handles API keys using environment variables.


How It Works
The AI agent processes a PDF document through a series of nodes in a LangGraph workflow:

Outline Creation: Generates a high-level outline from the PDF content.
Structured Outline: Converts the outline into a conversation plan for a two-person podcast.
Segment Transcript: Transforms the plan into natural-sounding spoken dialogue.
Deep Dive: Adds depth with analogies, examples, and background information.
Transcript Optimization: Refines the dialogue for clarity, coherence, and engagement.
Podcast Dialogue: Structures the transcript into a lively podcast format.
Outline Fusion: Re-aligns the dialogue with the original outline for consistency.
Revision: Polishes the dialogue for natural flow and storytelling.
Final Podcast Script: Produces a broadcast-ready script with sound cues (e.g., [music fades in]).
Audio Generation: Converts the script into audio output.

The workflow is powered by the Together AI LLM (meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct-Turbo-Free) and orchestrated by LangGraph for robust state management.

Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-to-podcast.git
cd pdf-to-podcast


Install Python:Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Check with:
python --version


Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Set Up Environment Variables:Create a .env file in the project root and add your Together AI API key:
TOGETHER_API_KEY=your_together_api_key_here

Install python-dotenv to load the .env file:
pip install python-dotenv


Prepare PDF Files:Place your input PDF (e.g., dbms.pdf) in the PDFs/ directory.



Usage

Run the Script:Execute the main script to process a PDF and generate a podcast script:
python main.py


Input:The script reads a PDF from PDFs/dbms.pdf (modify the path in main.py if needed).

Output:

A polished podcast script is printed to the console.
An audio file is generated using the create_audio utility (ensure the utility is configured).


Example:For a DBMS PDF, the output might look like:
**Intro Music Fades In**
Alex: "Welcome to Deep Dive Talks! Today, we‚Äôre exploring the world of Database Management Systems!"
Sam: "[chuckles] Ever wondered how your favorite apps store all that data? Let‚Äôs dive in!"
...
**Outro Music Fades In**
